## Supported Games

- Cyberpunk 2077
- Grand Theft Auto V

## Prerequisites

This plugin requires the [Wooting Analog SDK](https://github.com/WootingKb/wooting-analog-sdk/releases) to be installed. However, that doesn't mean it can only be used with Wooting keyboards, as there are [SDK plugins for other analog keyboards](https://github.com/AnalogSense/universal-analog-plugin).
